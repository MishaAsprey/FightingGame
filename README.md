# Fighting Game

This project is a simple fighting game. The core mechanic of the game will be its combat system.
Players will be able to select the direction of their attack/defence (top or bottom).
So, if one player chooses to attack from the top, the other player can select the same direction
in order to block the attack. This mechanic is currently not present in the game as this project is a work in progress.
However, a major part of the game was completed and you can see it on the screenshots below.

As of now, the game features three unique characters. They have different amount of health and damage. Their attack
speed and distance also differ in order to create a unique playstyle for every character.
